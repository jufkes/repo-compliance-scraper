# repo-compliance-scraper

Some scripts and junk for checking various things in a repository. This could be better structured so that processors and handlers live in the base and do away with the whole `dockerfile-security` sub project. I had a reason for doing a sub project but I cant for the life of me remember why...so I'll probably restructure it later.
